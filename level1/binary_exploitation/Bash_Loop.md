First of all we *SSH* into the system.
We then look in the folder specified by the problem and see that there are 2 files.
The flag and a file called *bashloop* asking for a number.

We don't have permission to read the flag-file, so we can't print the content using the *cat* command.

Since *bashloop* only asks for a value 0-4096 we can simply bruteforce this.
So what I did was create a **sh** file in my home directory with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
  for i in `seq 0 4096`;
  do
    /link/to/problem/bashloop $i > $i.out
  done
```

This creates 4097 files where only one will contain the flag.
So what I did was to run the following command to *grep* the flag from the correct file:

```bash
grep *.out -e "flag"
```
