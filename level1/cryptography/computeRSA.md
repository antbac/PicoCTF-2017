The problem is to decrypt a number that has been encrypted using RSA.

We are given the values of **d**, **N** and **c**.
The easiest way to solve this is to enter the values into an online-tool.
I decided to use this site: https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~introcs/Fa11/notes/10.1_Cryptography/RSA_Express_EncryptDecrypt.html.
