The problem wants us to upload our public key to their system in order to SSH into their system from a terminal.
A key may be generated by using the built-in ssh-keygen command like this:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

By default the file is saved to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

We can then print the key by using the cat command like this:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Lastly we copy our localy generated key to the server using the echo command through the terminal provided by the website like this:

```bash
echo "our_copied_key" > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
