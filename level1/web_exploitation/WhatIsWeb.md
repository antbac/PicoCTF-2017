The web-page we are given is rather boring.
So what we do first is to look at the source code.
In the code we can see a comment which gives us 1/3 of the key and tells us that the the other two are located on related pages.

Since a web-page is usually made up of a HTML, JavaScript and CSS file we can guess that these are the files they are referring to.
In the source-file of the HTML page we can find one JavaScript file and one CSS file.
Those are **script.js** and **hacker.css**.

We can find those files by adding */THE_FILENAME* to the end of the URL in the address bar of the web-browser.
